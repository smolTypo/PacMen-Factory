# PacMen-Factory
This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. Our task in this activity is to create a pacman on demand (button click) and move these pacmen across the page



Here's how the game is played:

When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
