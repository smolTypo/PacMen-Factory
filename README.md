This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp

Our task in this activity is to create a pacman on demand (button click) and move these pacmen across the page.

Demo: https://smoltypo.github.io/PacMen-Factory/

## About:

In this exercise we used JavaScript to the move the PacMan across the screen and to animate the character, stimulating the chomping movement whilst it moves across the screen.

## Here's how the game is played:

- Each time the "Add PacMan" button is clicked, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen
- When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
- When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

## How to run:
This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the 
same file structure (i.e. images folder with separately stored images.)

## Future roadmap:
This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated at this time.
